title: A Comparison Between ERC-20 and PSP-22 Fungible Token Standards

With the rise of blockchain technology, the need for fungible tokens has become increasingly important. Fungible tokens are digital assets that are interchangeable with each other and have identical values. They are commonly used in various blockchain applications, such as payment systems, loyalty programs, and decentralized exchanges.

Two of the most widely adopted standards for fungible tokens are ERC-20 for the Ethereum ecosystem and PSP-22 for the Substrate's contracts pallet. In this article, we will compare these two standards and explore their similarities and differences.

Comparison Table:

| Features                | ERC-20   | PSP-22   |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Total Supply            | 256 bit  | 128 bit  |
| Transfer                | Transfer | Transfer |
| Approve/Allowance       | Approve  | Approve  |
| Increase Allowance      | No       | Yes      |
| Decrease Allowance      | No       | Yes      |
| Name                    | Yes      | No       |
| Symbol                  | Yes      | No       |
| Decimals                | Yes      | No       |
| Metadata                | No       | Yes      |
| PSP22Receiver interface | No       | Yes      |
| Before_received method  | No       | Yes      |

As seen in the table, PSP-22 includes additional methods for managing allowance, metadata, and a PSP22Receiver interface with a before_received method. On the other hand, ERC-20 includes fields for name, symbol, and decimals that are not present in PSP-22. Additionally, PSP-22 has a smaller bit size for total supply compared to ERC-20.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, both ERC-20 and PSP-22 provide a standard interface for fungible tokens, but they differ in their implementation details. While ERC-20 includes additional fields for name, symbol, and decimals, PSP-22 provides more methods for managing allowance and metadata. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these standards are updated and expanded to meet the needs of new use cases.
