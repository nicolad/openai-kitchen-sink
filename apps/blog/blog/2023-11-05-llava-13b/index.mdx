Brainstorming new ideas is a lot harder when starting with a blank canvas.
It helps to begin with some seed ideas, which you can then use to iterate and develop into viable candidates that could meet your goals.
One example where this can be useful is in generating startup ideas.
A few seed ideas can help aspiring founders brainstorm the next big thing that they are going to build.

This article provides an overview of building a Startup Idea Generator app, which is based on the Python version available in the [Cohere documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/page/startup-idea-generator).

The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at [nicolad/openai-kitchen-sink](https://github.com/nicolad/openai-kitchen-sink/tree/main/apps/startup-idea-generator).

A live version of the app is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed here: [Startup Idea Generator App](https://startup-idea-generator-cohere.vercel.app/).
